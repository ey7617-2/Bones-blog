        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name's Erika, I'm 16 from Western Australia. I made this blog to share my thoughts and observations regarding the popular crime show <i>Bones</i>. I also made the choice to code this website myself, to more closely resemble web-design in in the era that the TV show was most popular, between 2005 and 2010. To do this, I had to learn two types of code, html and css.</p><b></b>
